# Farm To Table

For both farmers and consumers who need a convenient marketplace to buy and sell food from farms to the buyer’s homes. Farm2Table is an eCommerce platform that connects farms and consumers in close proximity, while making the process seamless for everyone. Unlike a traditional farmer’s market, grocery store delivery services, and grocery store online delivery services (Amazon Prime at Whole Foods, Safeway, Walmart, etc.) our product offers the ability to buy produce directly from local farms in the comfort of the consumer's home and at the convenience of their schedule.
